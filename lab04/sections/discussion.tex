\section{Procedure and discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
\texttt{tcp\-trace\-1.cap} contains traffic where a client uploads a the contents of \emph{Alice in Wonderland} to a remote server.
An HTTP POST initiates the upload and an HTTP 200 OK response is issued from the server when the upload is complete.
The TCP traffic in the file captures the entire conversation, starting with the three-way handshake, then the file transfer and finally the connection closure.
