\subsection{TCP Connection release}
\begin{Question}
	Which packets were used to close the data flow from the server to the client? How do you determine this?
\end{Question}
\begin{Answer}
	Packets 348 and 349 close the server $\rightarrow$ client connection.
	348 is a FIN, which requests to close the connection from the server to the client.
	The ACK in 349 confirms this closure.
\end{Answer}

\begin{Question}
	Which packets were used to close the data flow from the client to the server? How do you determine this?
\end{Question}
\begin{Answer}
	Packet 350 is a RST request from the client to the server.
	This terminates all existing connections and does not need an ACK.
\end{Answer}

\begin{Question}
	(Optional) In the FIN segment, what is the sequence number? In the corresponding ACK segment, what is the acknowledgement number? How did the client determine this number?
\end{Question}
\begin{Answer}
	FIN sequence number: 725 \\
	ACK sequence number: 726 \\
	As with all other ACKs, it is one up from the last received sequence.
	Nothing special happens.
\end{Answer}
