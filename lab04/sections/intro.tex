\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
This lab will examine the TCP header fields in depth, as well as several protocol behaviors.
The three-way handshake for connection setup is examined, followed by a reliable data flow.
The throttling effects of congestion control are observed in the sender's transmission rate.
Finally, the connection release behavior is examined.
