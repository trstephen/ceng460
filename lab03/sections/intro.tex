\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
This lab will investigate Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), Internet Protocol (IP) and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). ARP allows known IP addresses to be associated to unknown MAC addresses. Wireshark will be used to examine Ethernet frames for ARP messages. The contents of IP frames and content of ICMP messages will be examined. ICMP allows core IP functionality to be exposed as thought it were a higher level service and provide information about a network's functionality and structure.
