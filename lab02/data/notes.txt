Ethernet
	- What is the 48-bit MAC address of the client computer?
		00:d0:59:a9:3d:68

	- What is the 48-bit destination MAC address in the Ethernet frame? Is this the MAC address of gaia.cs.umass.edu? Which device has this MAC address?
		00:06:25:da:af:73
		00:06:25 corresponds to "LinksysG", which is a router manufacturer
		This is probably the address of the router.

	- Give the hexadecimal value for the two-byte Frame type field.
		Frame type: IP (0x0800)

	- What is the value of the source MAC address? Is this the address of your computer, or of gaia.cs.umass.edu? Which device has this MAC address?
		00:d0:59:a9:3d:68

	- What is the destination MAC address in the Ethernet frame? Is this supposed to be the Ethernet address of the computer you are using?
		00:d0:59:a9:3d:68, it's my computer!

	- Find the hexadecimal value for the two-byte Frame type field.
		Frame type: IP (0x0800)

WLAN
	- Which AP is the most active one (i.e., the one sends most Beacon messages)? What is its BSS ID?
		BSS ID: Cisco-Li_e3:e3:8f (00:16:b6:e3:e9:8f) sends all beacon requests. There are 458 of them.

	- How many Data frames are in the trace, how many subtypes they have, and what is the most common subtype of these Data frames?
		1783 	Data frames (wlan.fc.type == 2)
		1 		Data + CF-Poll (0x22)
		39		Null function (0x24)
		1743	Data (0x20)

	- How many subtypes of Control frames are in the trace, what are they, and what is the most common subtype?
		1391 	Control frames (wlan.fc.type == 1)
		1385 	Acknowledgement (0x1d)
		5 		Clear-to-send (0x1c)
		1 		Power-Save poll (0x1a)

	- How many subtype of Management frames are in the trace, what are they, and what is the most common subtype?
		557		Management frames (wlan.fc.type == 0)
		458		Beacon frame (0x08)
		81		Probe request (0x04)
		14 		Probe response (0x05)
		2 		Authentication (0x0b)
		1 		Authentication request (0x00)
		1 		Authentication response (0x01)

	- Estimate the retransmission times, i.e., the number of retransmissions (i.e., the total number of transmissions - number of original frames) over the number of original transmissions. Show your calculation.
		1783	Total data frames (wlan.fc.type == 2)
		1430	Data frame no retry (wlan.fc.type == 2 && wlan.fc.retry == 0)
		353		Data frame retry (wlan.fc.type == 2 && wlan.fc.retry == 1)


	- What are the Type and Subtype values for the Association Request / Association Response frames, Probe Request / Probe Response frames, respectively?
