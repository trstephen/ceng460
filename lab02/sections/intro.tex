\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
This lab will examine link layer traffic over Ethernet and IEEE 802.11 (wi-fi). Source and destination MAC addresses will be examined for Ethernet. The composition of frame subtypes in IEEE 802.11 will be identified and compared. The reliability of a IEEE 802.11 signal will be determined by examining a series of Data frames.
