\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
This lab will demonstrate the multi-layered design of a communications network by inspecting actual ethernet traffic.
Common Unix tools will be used to investigate host machine configuration and make simple calls to Internet addresses.
WireShark, a network analysis tool, is used to inspect raw traffic and expose information contained in each traffic layer.
