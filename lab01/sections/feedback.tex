	\item Use \texttt{tracert} to examine the routes traveled during the \texttt{ping} comparison in Section \ref{sec:tools}. Does this explain the difference in round trip times? Compare \texttt{.ca}, \texttt{.com}, \texttt{.co.uk} and \texttt{.cn} routes.
	\item Write a script to compute traffic overhead.
