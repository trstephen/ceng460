\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Retrieving a webpage with \texttt{wget} demonstrated that several protocols are necessary to retrieve HTTP content.
The high volume of frame traffic was exposed by WireShark.
The OSI model effectively obscures the bulk of this communication via protocols which communicate layer-to-layer.

\texttt{netstat} and \texttt{ifconfig} can be used to determine the network configuration of a Unix machine.
\texttt{ping} displays the transmission success and round trip time statistics from a machine to a remote address.

WireShark was able to display the header information from multiple protocols in \textit{lab1-wget-trace.pcap}.
The headers contained information about the type of the parent layer.
Headers made up a total of 6.78\% of the data from the server to the client.
